# Python_tracer_exchange
This Python code is used to simulate the tracer exchange process between the electrodes and the electrolyte in the Li/LLZO/Li symmetrical cell.

The <sup>6</sup>Li abundance in the electrode and the electrolyte will be simulated and saved to a .txt file in the same directoty as the script.
